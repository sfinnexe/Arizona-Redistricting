# Arizona Congressional District Compactness Scores: Overview
*Project from GIS for Electoral Redistricting Analysis with Professor Lee Hachadoorian*  
- In this project I analyzed the change in compactness scores of Arizona's congressional districts over time based on different measures of compactness. 
- I compared the Polsby-Popper and Reock compactness scores from the 1970s until 2010.
